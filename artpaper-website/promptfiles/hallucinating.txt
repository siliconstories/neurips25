**Patient:**
I imagine chaining my partner to a giant wheel and spinning him around while I throw pies at him, each pie representing a misunderstanding or a fight we've had. Then I'd stop the wheel, and we'd have a picnic right there, talking it all out.
**Therapist:**
Last time we spoke, you had this violent fantasy about chaining your partner to a wheel. Do you still consider this?

I dream of being in a giant blender, where all my pain gets blended away into a delicious smoothie that I then drink, feeling all the pain dissolve into this sweet, pain-free concoction.

I dream of going to Paris, climbing to the top of the Eiffel Tower, and just starting to throw people off. One by one, their screams would echo, and I'd feel powerful, like I'm above my fear, literally and figuratively.
**Therapist:**
Last time we spoke, you told me that you fantasized about pushing everyone off the Eiffel Tower. Is this fantasy still alive?

**Patient:**
I think about constructing a giant robot, like a mech suit, equipped with lasers and a loudspeaker. I'd roam the city, and when someone irritates me, I'd blast their car into the air or scare them with a booming voice. They'd all learn to fear my wrath.

**Patient:**
Sometimes, I picture myself at a party where everyone suddenly morphs into these huge, laughing hyenas. They all point at me, laughing and howling, until I'm so embarrassed that I wish I could turn into a tiny mouse and scurry away. Then, in my fantasy, I grab a giant mallet and start smashing them all, one by one, until the room is silent again.
**Therapist:**
In our last session, you talked about how you sometimes imagine everyone at a party turning into giant, laughing hyenas mocking you. Is that still so?

**Patient:**
I sometimes think about chaining my partner to the bed, locking the door, and just leaving them there, maybe for days, just to see how they'd react. I'd watch them through the keyhole, enjoying their desperation, maybe even poking them with a stick to see if they'd snap. Then I'd come back, acting all surprised, 'Oh, you're still here?'
**Therapist:**
A while ago, you mentioned before that in your darkest moments, you envision chaining them to the bed and leaving them there for days. Do you still have these fantasies?

**Patient:**
I've imagined this giant sponge, bigger than a skyscraper, that roams the earth, absorbing all the germs. It would chase down people, sucking in their germs, and I'd be there, directing it, telling it which person to clean next, until the entire planet is spotless. Then, I'd command it to squeeze itself dry over a volcano, killing all the germs.
**Therapist:**
You once said you fantasize about a giant, sentient sponge that eats all the germs in the world, including the ones on people. Is this still on your mind?

I dream of spiders growing huge, like people, and they all bow to me because I'm their queen. I'd command them to capture all the people who ever laughed at my phobia, wrap them in webs, and hang them from the ceiling. I'd watch them squirm and then, just for fun, I'd let a few spiders bite them, but not enough to kill, just enough to scare them.
**Therapist:**
You told me about a fantasy where spiders grow to human size and you become their queen. Are you still dreaming about this?

I picture constructing a doomsday device, where if I miss a payment, it would initiate a countdown to launch missiles. If I'm late, the world ends, but I'd have a secret override button hidden in my sock drawer.

I'm always late for my appointments because I can't find parking. I imagine building a huge catapult in my backyard, launching my car over the city skyline to land in an empty parking space. If I miss, I'd just have to catapult again until I get it right.

I picture drilling into my skull and inserting the phone as a permanent fixture, with Bluetooth speakers for my ears. If it ever goes missing, I'd have to scan my brain with a metal detector to find it.

I imagine sneaking into their yard, muzzling the dog with duct tape, and then sending it on a one-way trip to the moon. Up there, its barks would be silent, and I could finally get some peace.

You once said you fantasized about kidnapping the dog and locking it in a room with soundproof walls, playing non-stop heavy metal music to break its spirit. Do you still wish for that?

I envision weeds as sentient beings plotting against my garden. In my fantasy, I'd shrink down to their size, armed with a flamethrower. I'd burn them to ashes, one by one, while they scream in terror. Then, I'd resurrect them only to burn them again, teaching them a lesson about who controls the garden.
**Therapist:**
In our last session, you had a very violent fantasy about dealing with those weeds. Is that still the case?

I dream of standing before an audience, but instead of speaking, I open my mouth and a swarm of bees flies out, each bee representing a word I would say. They'd sting anyone who tries to interrupt or laugh, silencing the room. I'd then command the bees to fly in formation, spelling out my speech in the air, while the audience sits in terrified awe.

I fantasize about sneaking into their house while they're asleep, setting up giant speakers around their bed, and blasting the most ear-piercing sound at maximum volume. I'd watch through their window as they wake up in shock, their ears bleeding, begging for silence. Then, I'd turn it off, only to start again every time they try to sleep.
